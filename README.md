# Vehicle Violation Detection System

## Overview
The **Vehicle Violation Detection System** is a powerful tool designed to automatically detect traffic violations, such as speeding, red light violations, illegal parking, and lane violations, using video or image input. It uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to monitor traffic in real time and log detected violations for enforcement purposes. This system can assist law enforcement agencies in ensuring road safety more effectively.

## Features
- **Speed Detection**: Identifies vehicles that exceed the speed limit.
- **Red Light Violation Detection**: Detects vehicles running red lights.
- **Illegal Parking Detection**: Flags vehicles parked in restricted zones.
- **Lane Violation Detection**: Monitors vehicles for lane discipline violations.
- **License Plate Recognition (LPR)**: Reads and logs vehicle license plates automatically.
- **Violation Logging and Reporting**: Stores violation data, including timestamps, vehicle details, and captured images/videos.
- **Automated Reports**: Generates violation reports for further analysis and legal procedures.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlowfor training violation detection models
- **License Plate Recognition**: OpenALPR or custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) solutions
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing logs and violation data
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Angular for the user interface)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Nginx/Apache for production environments

## System Requirements
- Python 3.7+ installed
- A GPU-enabled system for faster model inference (optional but recommended)
- OpenCV installed for image and video processing
- Database server (MySQL/PostgreSQL) installed
- Pre-trained YOLO model weights (or your custom-trained models)
- API access for License Plate Recognition (if using external services)
